# knacktive

Knacktive is an integrated, interactive marketing communications agency which incorporates the principles, strategies and tactics of design, marketing and public relations. The agency is comprised of students at Northwest Missouri State University as a way to learn from real scenarios in an agency setting.

This repository contains the initial website, built by myself, then later integrated into a CMS.

The website was built with HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Adobe Dreamweaver was used as an IDE which allowed me to create a reusable template for the pages. This was common prior to all the templating engines that are common today.
