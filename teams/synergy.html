                >I struggled with this one for a long time. I suppose my 'knack'
                would be the way I communicate with people. I love to meet new
                people and I always feel extremely comfortable going up to
                someone and starting a conversation. I think of myself as a very
                personable person and a good listener at the same time. I think
                strong communication is one of the most import skills that
                someone can posses, and I love being able to call this my
                'knack.'</span

              <span id="member2" class="knack"
                >Illustration is a huge passion of mine. I sketch constantly,
                but usually never in my sketchbook. I love drawing and painting,
                both on paper and digitally. I try to do something artistic each
                day; or, at the very least, read about art. I'm constantly
                pushing myself to learn more about design and
                illustration.</span

                imagination and curiosity run wild. I write every day, even if
                it's just a random thought that crossed my mind in class.
                Growing up I always kept journals and I was the queen of writing
                notes in middle school. I'm more of a visual person, so writing
                my thoughts down is my way of organizing and analyzing how I
                feel.</span

                our combined personalities. Creating something people can

                growing up and I loved it! When I was 18 I started to play small
                buy-in games of poker with friends and found I could
                consistently win. Over the last couple of years, I have been
                able to earn enough to pay for educational costs...and then
                some! :)</span

                >My Knack is curiosity...I believe that curiosity leads to the
                act of asking questions that sparks simple ideas. I have always
                had a curiosity of what is near me or half way around the world;
                this is why I love to travel. By stepping outside my normal
                boarders, traveling has giving me the opportunity to leap into
                new cultures and meet new people. Each experience of curiosity
                has lead to fresh insight on all of my views in life and I
                continue to push myself to new elevations.</span

                snowboard with my friends. It is very relaxing to me and I love
                the adrenaline rush I get from the sport. Snowboarding is a
                challenge I attempt to defeat as often as possible!!</span

                >French Roast. House Blend. Some call me the coffee connoisseur,
                but I consider it more of a best friend. While we have never
                stayed up late telling secrets or braiding each other's hair, we
                have shared plenty of sleepless nights. Coffee is a friend I
                often lean on to help me with my Knack or ability to pull epic
                all-nighters and enjoy them along the way. Like most best
                friends, coffee and I are in it for the long haul.</span
