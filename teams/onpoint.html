                <p><strong>Knack:</strong> 
                	<span id="member1" class="knack">My Knack is golf which has teed up my team cohesiveness. I have played for the past 10 years and was on the first varsity women's golf team at Northwest Missouri State University. Being a senior, golf has helped with time management and really helped me get into the swing of things. I have a real drive and passion for being a part of a strong above par team and being a strong leader. My golf team experience has taught me that as account executive, I don't have the skills to do it all on my own, but I know I have the right clubs in the bag to get the job done.</span>
                    <span id="member2" class="knack">I have a knack for creating. Whether it's an eye-catching design or a plate of spaghetti, I love to dive in and have fun with it. My style is big and bold and I love to experiment whether it is with crazy designs or random spices. I may be soft spoken, but only because I speak through what I create.</span>
                 	<span id="member3" class="knack">My knack is writing. I enjoy the creativity that writing expresses. With writing any situation can come alive through an array of words. It is a way to analyze any aspect of a given situation logically and creatively while still providing a tangible result.</span>
                    <span id="member4" class="knack">Music is my knack. I listen to music daily and have a very eclectic taste in music. My favorite bands range from Def Leppard (being number one) to Jason Aldean along with Disturbed and Creedence Clearwater Revival. I have over 4,000 songs on my iPod.</span>
                    <span id="member5" class="knack">My 'Knack' would be in computers and technology. I love to tinker with my computer to see how far I can push it like installing a new piece of hardware. I also enjoy new gadgets and seeing what I can do with them. Whether it's a new piece of software to make a task easier or a device that has multiple functions, I like finding out about them and applying them to my life.</span>
                    <span id="member6" class="knack">I like to think I have a knack for playing tasty jams on my guitar. Being a musician has been very rewarding for me and life without it would not be legitimate.</span>
                    <span id="member7" class="knack">Aside from my communications career path, I maintain creativity through a different type of thread. I have a knack for quilting. I live for an array of odd-ball colors and designs. When life gives you scraps, stitch quilts!</span>
                    <span id="member8" class="knack">I enjoy being outdoors especially when it involves fishing. Every summer since I have been in college, I have traveled with a group of my friends to Minnesota to go Northern Pike fishing. I would like to eventually own a cabin in northern Minnesota where I can visit to relax and get away.</span>
