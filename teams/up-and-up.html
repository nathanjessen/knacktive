                <p><strong>Knack:</strong> 
                	<span id="member1" class="knack">I have a knack for cooking. I learned to cook from my mother after I moved out of her house when I was eighteen. I can make anything from scratch that has a recipe and can guarantee that it will taste great!</span>
                    <span id="member2" class="knack">I have a knack with the artwork produced by Shepard Fairey. He is also the creator of OBEY Clothing. His paintings are amazing and they are something everyone should experience.</span>
                 	<span id="member3" class="knack">I love to plan events, whether it's a dinner party with friends or an event to raise money for other organizations. I just love finding the tiniest of details to make the event seem complete. I often find ways to create all of my decorations rather than buy them so that I can insure they are original.</span>
                    <span id="member4" class="knack">My Knacks are drawing in my sketchbook and taking photographs. I love sketching and taking notes in my sketchbook and turning those sketches into computerized versions of my drawings. I also love to take pictures, which I do in my free time.</span>
                    <span id="member5" class="knack">My job as a PERT. Although I carry senior status, I still live on a floor full of obnoxious freshman guys. Why? I love the job. My teammates are great and I love helping the Millikan Hall residents on a day-to-day basis. Fixing their computers and teaching people about new technology is extremely rewarding and that is why I have stuck with it for three years!</span>
                    <span id="member6" class="knack">As an outgoing and creative person, I have an uncanny "Knack" for being able to make nothing into something. I enjoy taking challenges head on and by taking the path less traveled, I often find myself with results that far exceed my expectations.</span>
                    <span id="member7" class="knack">Devin is a public relations pro who is rarely seen without her trusty old school Ipod, rocking out to her favorite Glee tunes. When it comes to PR she has all the right moves and will make you sing her praises. Get ready to Gleek out over this public relations director.</span>
                    <span id="member8" class="knack">My knack is my ability to take my competitive drive from sports and use it in other areas of my life, like my education and class.</span>
