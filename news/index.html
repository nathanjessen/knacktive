        	<h3>Select Northwest Students Create New Agency and Client Plans</h3>
            <p>Northwest Missouri State University students are gaining professional experience running an integrated marketing communications agency under the guidance of selected faculty members. Students were selected to participate in this pilot program from the art, business, communications, computer science and mass communication departments. The course objective is to research and develop a marketing communications plan for a 'real world' client, under the guidance of the faculty team. At the same time, this first group of students has the opportunity to create the organization from the ground up, including naming the agency.</p>
            <p>The first student project was to create the company and logo. The name the students created for their organization is Knacktive. "Knacktive is a name we felt really fit our organization. All of the students in this organization have a special ability or 'knack' and when we all work together we can use our talents to create something great for our client," explained Rob O'Doherty, a Knacktive Account Executive and senior public relations major.</p>
            <p>All students involved in this program will receive three  hours of credit for their work, while developing numerous professional-grade, portfolio-ready work samples. While working on various parts of the client's marketing communication plan students are also given weekly tutorials, instruction, and feedback by the participating faculty members.</p>
            <p>The lead Knacktive faculty advisor, Stephanie Padgett, originally implemented a similar program at the University of Missouri's school of journalism in 2005, completing projects for such brands as Redbox, Hallmark and Purina. The other Knacktive faculty include: Judy Clark, Chris Graves, David Shadinger and Carol Spradling. The faculty members are from departments representing the same major degree concentrations as the students.</p>
            <p>The mission of Knacktive is to allow Northwest Missouri State University students to develop their skills and abilities while gaining hands-on experience in a technology focused, agency-style setting.</p>
